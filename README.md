# 2D Collision Detection Optimization Algorithm

Traditional collision detection methods, such as brute force algorithms that check every pair of objects in a scene, can be highly computationally expensive, especially when dealing with a large number of objects or complex shapes. This can lead to significant processing overheads, resulting in decreased application performance and responsiveness. As a consequence, there is a critical need for more efficient and optimized collision detection algorithms in 2D environments.

This repository focuses on implementing a QuadTree-based optimization algorithm for 2D collision detection. A QuadTree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children: northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast. It's particularly well-suited for spatial partitioning tasks, such as collision detection, as it recursively divides space into quadrants, allowing for efficient querying of objects within specific regions. The algorithm minimizes the number of pairwise collision checks required, making it highly efficient for scenarios involving a large number of objects.
